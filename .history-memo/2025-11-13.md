# [10:50:54] - MAGUS Council → gemini

fix this code:
TEMPLATE_FILE = os.path.join(INPUT_DIR, "prayer.md")

the TEMPLATE_FILE is in OUTPUT_DIR
run duplicate_file() from last saturday file and rename it to next saturday

Open files:
process_prayer_breakfast.py

# [10:57:22] - MAGUS Council → gemini

enforced this rule forever:

1. INPUT_DIR is read only

2. the current file in the OUTPUT_DIR is read only

3. only the new duplicated file can be written.

install requirement.txt

# [11:22:28] - MAGUS Council → gemini

rename_title() is similar to duplicate_file().

in this case, "## 2025-11-08 Saturday Prayer Breakfast Agenda" is replaced with "## 2025-11-15 Saturday Prayer Breakfast Agenda"
