Order Breakfast, Offering time, Opening Prayer by TaeWoo Lee

Bible Reading Rotation - Hebrews 11:1-19
1. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
2. For by it the elders obtained a good report.
3. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
4. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
5. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
6. But without faith
it is impossible to please
him:
 for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and
that
 he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
7. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
8. By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
9. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as
in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
10. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker
is God.
11. Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
12. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of
them, and embraced
them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
14. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
15. And truly, if they had been mindful of that
country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
16. But now they desire a better
country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
17. By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
son,
18. Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
19. Accounting that God
was able to raise
him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

Prayer Card Together - Page 38 II—STUDYING: 4. II Timothy 3:16-17
1. All scripture
is given by inspiration of God, and
is
 profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
2. That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

Our core value of an ongoing emphasis on the importance of fulfilling the spiritual objective of being Men and Women of Separated Walk. 2 CORINTHIANS 6:14-18
1. Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
2. And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
3. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in
them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
4. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean
thing; and I will receive you,
5. And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
